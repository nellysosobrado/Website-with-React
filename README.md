# Silicon - Website Made with React

I made a website called **Silicon** using **React** and **Vite**

- **Fast Updates**: When I make changes, they show up right away!
- **Works Everywhere**: You can use it on your phone, tablet, or computer.
- **Clean Code**: I used ESLint to keep the code neat and tidy

## What I Used

- **React**: To build the website and make it look awesome.
- **Vite**: To make building the website super fast and easy.
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: To add cool animations when you scroll.
- **React Router DOM**: To help you move between different pages on the website.
- **Responsive Design**: So the website looks good on any device, big or small.
